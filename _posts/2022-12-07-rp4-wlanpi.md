For the past several years, I've been leveraging the original WLAN Pi to help troubleshoot my occasional wireless problems.  I'll say this, it is an awesome tool that I continue to use.  That said, you can no longer build or buy the original type -- the base NEO2 is no longer manufactured.  

Thanks to the community geniuses behind the WLAN Pi, an alternative was developed that only provides further functionality.
