title: 'Becoming a Python expert'

I recently learned of a podcast called "Talk Python to Me"; specifically, I listened to an episode entitled [10 Tips and Ideas for the Beginner to Expert Python Journey](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/427/10-tips-and-ideas-for-the-beginner-to-expert-python-journey).  I can't call myself a Python expert -- probably can't call myself on the intermediate spectrum.  I am, though, more than a beginner and I always appreciate something that will better help me in writing python scripts and programs.  I would like to highlight the 10 tips and ideas they mentioned:

- **Know Your Goals**: for myself, I initially learned Python to help me in my job as a Network Engineer.  Since then, I have found value with Python in building tasks automations, small applications, and ways to help in the network.  
- **Have a Project in Mind**: Hearing this, I now want to find another project that will allow me to use Python.  Not sure what that will be -- just need to find it.  
- **Don't limit your learning to what's needed for the project**
- **Read good code**: A good point, but I'm not sure where to go looking for "good" code.  
- **Know your tools**: He specifically recommended taking a few days just to learn your IDE.  I just gained a new co-worker who also uses VS Code, but he puts it into VIM mode.  
- **Learn how to test your code**: This is something I definitely need to start doing.  
- **Know what's good enough for a project***
- **Embrace refactoring**: I have a project, now a year old, that needs some refactoring.  
- **Write things down**
- **Go meet people**: I took his advice on this item and I attended a Python user group.  Those in attendance use Python far more frequently than myself; yet, I hope to be able to learn some things.  

The co-collaborator to the podcast actually made a post on on this topic as well.  You can find it at [this link](https://mostlypython.substack.com/p/transitioning-out-of-the-beginner)
