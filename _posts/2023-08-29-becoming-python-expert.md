title: 'Becoming a Python expert'

I recently learned of a podcast called "Talk Python to Me"; specifically, I listened to an episode entitled [10 Tips and Ideas for the Beginner to Expert Python Journey](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/427/10-tips-and-ideas-for-the-beginner-to-expert-python-journey).  I can't call myself a Python expert -- probably can't call myself on the intermediate spectrum.  I am, though, more than a beginner and I always appreciate something that will better help me in writing python scripts and programs.  I would like to highlight the 10 tips and ideas they mentioned:

- **Know Your Goals**:
- **Have a Project in Mind**:
- **Don't limit your learning to what's needed for the project**:
- **Read good code**:
- **Know your tools**:
- **Learn how to test your code**:
- **Know what's good enough for a project***:
- **Embrace refactoring**: 
- **Write things down**:
- **Go meet people**:
