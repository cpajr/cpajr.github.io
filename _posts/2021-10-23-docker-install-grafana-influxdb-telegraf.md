title: 'Docker Install for Grafana, InfluxDB, and Telegraf'
---

# Introduction

Several years ago, I created a post describing the process to install Grafana, InfluxDB, and Telegraf on CentOS.  I've used this combination to provide monitoring and visualiation of a network for many years.  Honestly, it has served me well.  But, as can be expected, I've grown to appreciate the flexiblity and ease of using Docker to deploy applications.  I particularly appreciate the bundled nature of a Docker application.  This post will be a follow up to my previous article, [Installing Influxdb, Telegraf, and Grafana on CentOS](https://cpajr.com/install-influxdb-telegraf-grafana/)
