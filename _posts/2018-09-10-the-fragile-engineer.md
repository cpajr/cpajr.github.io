title: 'The Fragile Engineer'
---

I have worked with a large variety of people, all with different backgrounds, experiences, and personalities.  I came across an [article from Packetpushers](https://goo.gl/s4tdN1) where the traits of a fragile engineer are discussed.  Thankfully, I haven't encountered any one individual with all of these traits -- I can only imagine what that would be like.  However, most people, including myself, might have one of these traits.  Usually better to understand them and be alert to anyone you might have.
