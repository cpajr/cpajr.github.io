Recently came across a [post on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrncciew/status/1556651168155467777?s=20&t=ilfvzg4N_P8iA11341oOgg){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} which shared of a wireless tool developed by Cisco.  The tool is called [WiFi Hawk](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/wireless-troubleshooting-tools/#!wifi-hawk/key--features){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.  

In short, the tool ingests a wireless capture and gives information of what is captured in a Excel spreadsheet.  It gives details of the broadcasting SSIDs and the clients that might be associated to them.  I have yet to use it much, but I'm always willing to share of a potential tool.
