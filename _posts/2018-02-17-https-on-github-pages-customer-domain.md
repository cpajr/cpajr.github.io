title: 'Providing HTTPS with a custom domain on Github pages'
---

This is really my first post to this new blog.  I've been working this past several days to provide my blog through Github pages.  Interesting conversion but it appears to be working well.  The one downside is that I cannot natively provide my blog in a secure fashion.  Thankfully, people smarter than myself have already figured this out.  Jonathan Petitcolas provided a straight forward how-to provide HTTPS for your Github website.  Take a look at his [blog entry](https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2017/01/13/using-https-with-custom-domain-name-on-github-pages.html)
